    [JSON]

    - JSON stands for “JavaScript Object Notation”
    - This is a data format that is useful for transmission between server and client
    - It’s primary benefit is that it represents data as
    - JavaScript data structures, so that once received on the client, the data can be directly manipulated by
    - JavaScript code without any extraction or manipulation
    - However, JSON parsers are not standard on most computer languages.
    - Support to manipulate JSON data is limited.


    [JSON vs XML]

    - JSON vs XML
    - JSON is an alternative to XML for representing structured data to be retrieved from an application server and manipulated on a client
    - JSON is text, and is retrieved as such (by using responseText)
    - Once accessed on the client, JavaScript functions can directly manipulate the information, rather than using the DOM API, or XSLT transformation
    - Often the JSON representation of data will be (a little) shorter than XML representation
